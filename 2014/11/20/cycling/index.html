<p>Today I put my 200th mile on my new bicycle.</p>

<p>Mid-way through last month,  I decided I wanted to start biking to work. And so I spent a few days researching like crazy trying to decide what type of bike to ride. I landed on the <a href="http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/outlaw-discbrake-crossbikes.htm">2015 Motobecane Fantom Cross Outlaw</a>. Light aluminum frame (no worries about rust), decent Shimano shifters/derailleurs, all-weather disk brakes, and braze-ons for fenders and racks. A great all around bike, and especially great for my short but hilly commute. And all for a good price.</p>

<p>It is now November, and getting a little chilly... so one might ask, why now, of all times, would one want to start commuting to work via bicycle?</p>

<p>My reasoning revolved around the following thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm fully convinced that cycling (especially if we sell one of our two vehicles) will be a wise <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/">financial <strong>and</strong> physical investment</a>.</li>
<li>If I make it through the winter, I think it's safe to say that I'll stick with cycling.</li>
<li>I want to be outside more/fend off cabin fever.</li>
<li>It's good exercise, which is something I've been struggling with since finishing college.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've biked every day so far this month except for four. Two of those were rest days. I didn't have time to bike another. And the last day... I wussed out because it was really cold and raining hard. But, it's been awesome. It's been in the mid-20's outside the past few days... and I love it. Every day feels like an accomplishment, and <em>almost</em> every day I am a little faster. I get to breathe more fresh air, see more trees, and feel more wind. It's wonderfully satisfying, and I look forward to my ride each morning more than I ever thought I would.</p>

<p>Granted, I'm less than a month in... so maybe the thrill is in the newness of it all and will wear off with time... but I doubt it. :)</p>

<p>I bought the following equipment to make commuting easier -- after all, if it's miserable experience, I'm not sure I'd be able to will myself do it long-term. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D9B7OKQ/">A bike stand</a> - awesome for assembling and tuning my bike. Would have been a real pain without.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012Q41HY/">Multi-tool</a> - highly recommended around the Internet... figured this would be good to have for any quick adjustments on the road.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AT33CW/">Combo pedals</a> - I don't have or wear cleats yet, and probably won't 'til the summer at the soonest... so these seemed like a future-proof option.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AO7ETQ">Helmet mirror</a> - Yep, it makes me look like a goof... but it is nice to not have to twist all the way around on my bike to see behind me. I got the compact version, but wish I would have gotten the regular one. The compact version feels a little too small/short.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041XA1D8">Fenders</a> - Great for those puddly and/or slushy days. These are awesome.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIAVHE">Rack</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZKES0S/">bag/panniers</a> - rack seems solid, and the bag's panniers are large enough for my laptop/s. I've heard this bag doesn't hold up the best, and it's not water<em>proof</em> without the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Topeak-Trunk-Bicycle-Rain-Cover/dp/B000ZKAU0A/">rain cover</a>... just water resistant. But, so far, I've been very happy with it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E1NQ696/">Lights</a> - so I can see and be seen. These lights are really bright, and seem pretty slick so far. <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-commuter-bike-lights/">The SweetHome likes them, too.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the things mentioned in the post may or may not warrant a more detailed post in the future, especially as things wear and age -- I'm interested in the longevity and durability of things like the bag, and the lights. They get used every day.</p>

<p>Anyway, you could have the same setup for less than $1,500 up front. I bet that's cheaper than any car you're looking at. Quite possibly more fun, too. :)</p></div>
